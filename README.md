Welcome to Tripr, the environmentally friendly trip advisor!  

If you are new to Tripr, you will be asked to create a user profile.  Some features are available to sample without a user profile, but it only takes a few moments to create a profile and get the full experience of the app.  With Tripr, you can view travel destinations on a map, log trips that you've taken that include blogs and pictures, and you can invite your friends to join so that they can see all the beautiful places you've been to!  

# Creating-a-Profile

When you open the web page, you will be prompted to log in.  You will click on the 'login' icon, even if you have not yet created a user profile.  Once the 'login' icon is clicked, you will be prompted to either login with your current username and password, or, if you do not have one yet, you may use the opportunity to create a user profile.  To create a profile, enter your first and last name, your e-mail address, and a unique password.  The password must be at least 8 characters in length.  

# Create a trip

Once a profile has been created or the exisint user has logged in, then you will be able to create a trip.  You will be prompted to enter the location and the date of the trip you wish to create a log for, and in the 'memories' section, you can reflect on your vacation experience and share all the details of your adventure!

# View your trip location on an interactive map!

Once you have created the trip and pressed the 'create' button, you will be directed to a page that shows you the location of your most recent trip, along with any previously logged trips, on a map provided by Google.  You can also upload photos, make comments on your trip, view comments others have left on your trip, or view trips and photos of people within your social circle!
